                <p class="project-desc">The FleetNetwork is a network of droids that all work together as a collective mind to complete a goal. We have designed different types of droids for different tasks.</p>
                <p class="project-desc">Our goal is to tidy up the planet, these droids will collect harmful things to the environment and put them places where they can be dealt with properly.</p>
                <p class="project-desc">Using a centralized server the droids have an adaptive brain, meaning they can reposed to any situation thrown at them</p>
                <p class="project-desc">We hope to keep expanding and make as much of a positive impact as possible.</p>
